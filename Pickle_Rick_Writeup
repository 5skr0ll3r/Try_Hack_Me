As it says it self it's a webserver so we dont have to nmap if we dont want to,
but feel free to try 

Index.html:
"
  Check source code
    Username: R1ckRul3s
"
Robots.txt:
"
  Always check if there is a robots.txt even if the DirBuster wont detect it or any other program
  
    PassWord: Wubbalubbadubdub
"

After that go to the login page http://<ip>/login.php
You can now exec commands on the machine
try ls to see what file exist

First_Ingredient:
"
  To see the content of the file type:
    base64 Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt | base64 --decode    
"
The second ingridiant is in another directory you can ls ../.. and see what other directories exist
The one we want is the rick directory in home ../../../home/rick/
So..

Second_Ingrediant:
"
    base64 ../../../home/rick/'second ingredients' | base64 --decode
"
Now The third ingr is in the root directory
But dont worry theres no pass for sudo if you do: sudo -l 
Output:
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on ip-10-10-81-23.eu-west-1.compute.internal:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on ip-10-10-81-23.eu-west-1.compute.internal:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

And bcs of that we dont even have to connect to 
the server via a reverse_shell

Third_And_Final_Ingrediant:
"
    sudo base64 ../../../root/3rd.txt | base64 --decode
"

And you are done!
Follow me -_-
